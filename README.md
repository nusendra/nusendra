### Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

You can reach out to me via my website at https://nusendra.com. I also regularly publish tutorials on programming and related topics on https://leskoding.com, and you can find my video tutorials on my YouTube channel at https://www.youtube.com/@leskoding.

At present, I'm actively engaged in freelancing through Upwork, and I'm also dedicated to crafting educational content for an Indonesian learning platform. My primary expertise lies in TypeScript and JavaScript.

When it comes to developing web applications, I'm a big fan of Vue, Svelte, Astro, ExpressJS, GraphQL, and Google Cloud. For mobile applications, I lean towards utilizing React Native.

Don't hesitate to get in touch with me if you have inquiries or if you're interested in collaborating on projects. I'm always open to new opportunities!
