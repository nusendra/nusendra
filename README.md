### Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

You can contact me through my website: https://nusendra.com. I also share tutorials on https://leskoding.com and https://www.youtube.com/@leskoding.

Currently, I am working on freelance projects on Upwork and creating programming content for an Indonesian learning platform. I specialize in TypeScript and JavaScript.

My favorite tools for building web applications are Vue, Svelte, Astro, ExpressJS, GraphQL, and Google Cloud. For mobile apps, I prefer to use React Native.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or projects you'd like to collaborate on!
